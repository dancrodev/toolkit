BLUF:  **Use at your own risk.** üôÇ

The scripts, tools, and automations in this repo are just *some* of the ones I've created and use as part of my everyday toolkit. They were created by me, for me, to solve very specific problems, and I've made them public in case they help someone else.

```
That said, they come with:

- No warranty
- No support
- No guarantees
- No roadmaps
- No promises of updates or improvements
- No merged pull requests (except in rare unicorn-grade situations)
- No stack traces read on your behalf
- No tech support hotline (it's just me yelling at a terminal)
- No refunds (you paid nothing, and that's what you'll get back)
- No "Works on My Machine" certification - even though it does
- No emotional support if it bricks your weekend
- I'm really just talking to myself now, aren't I?
- Well, since it's just me down here...
- Remember to buy milk
- .. and Tivo the next season of Grey's Anatomy.
- Well, hell, now I don't remember how to get out of this box. 
- Send help, the skeleton has me tied up underneath the shed.
